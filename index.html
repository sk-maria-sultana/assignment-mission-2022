            <p>This skillset involves the actual presentation of your websiteâ€”how the information in your website is
                laid out in browsers and on mobile devices as well. A dedicated frontend developer will be very
                experienced working with HTML and CSS, as well as the scripting language JavaScript. With these
                languages, the developer can very efficiently manipulate the information on a website to make it
                appealing and effective.</p>
